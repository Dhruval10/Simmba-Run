# Simmba-run

Final Group Project for Game Programming - CS485


The greenery and wilderness is where our story takes place. Simmba was happily staying in his sweet home with his parents. One day, out of eagerness, he stepped out of his home all alone in the middle of the night , when his parents along with his elder sister were in a sound sleep. As he has never gone out alone before, he lost his way to home and ended up in a bush green jungle nearby. 

You are the only help for Simmba now. Try avoiding all the obstacles coming in the way of Simmba so that his health does not deteriorate while travelling through the jungle. Also you should try and collect all the immunity boosters coming along the travel for survival of Simmba. 

The life of Simmba and reunion with his family is all you should think now!!
